\section{Body Sections}

This part will vary from thesis to thesis, but might include things like the following
(in as many different sections as are appropriate to organize the material well):

\begin{itemize}
\item mathematical foundations
\item context, with citations and discussion of work upon which the main topic is founded
\item a section about one approach to this work, with citations and discussion of one approach
\item a section about a separate basic approach, with citations and discussion of this other approach
\item a section about open questions and proposed further investigation (this is where you'd explain what you could explore in the spring, and how you'd go about it).
\end{itemize}

In a spring-semester thesis, you would also have a write-up of your own work,
and that part of the thesis would be like the contributions of other papers
you've been reading.
