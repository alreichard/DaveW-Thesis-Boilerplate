abstract = {Simplicity and visibility are two important characteristics of programming languages for 
novices. Novices start programming with very little idea of the properties of the notional machine 
implied by the language they are learning. To help them learn these properties, the notional machine 
should be simple. That is, it should consist of a small number of parts that interact in ways that 
can be easily understood, possibly by analogy to other mechanisms with which the novice is more familiar. 
A notional machine is the idealized model of the computer implied by the constructs of the programming 
language. Visibility is concerned with methods for viewing selected parts and processes of this 
notional machine in action. We introduce the term “commentary” which is the system's dynamic 
characterization of the notional machine, expressed in either text or pictures on the user's terminal. 
We examine the simplicity and visibility of three systems, each designed to provide programming experience 
to different populations of novices.}

    It starts by presenting a fairly idiosyncratic view of teaching programming which makes use of mechanistic analogies and points out some of the pitfalls.
    The article goes on to examine certain errors based on the misapplication of analogies as well as certain interaction errors.
    The main emphasis is on the notional machine both at the general level of understanding (and misunderstanding)
      the relationship of the terminal to the computer as such, as well as at the more specific level of understanding assignment.
    Notation and mistakes that poorly-designed languages can induce novices to commit are discussed. }

that have contributed to our understanding of the challenges that novice programmers
face when learning about the runtime dynamics of programs and the role of the computer
in program execution. More specifically, the review covers the literature on programming
misconceptions, the cognitive theory of mental models, constructivist theory of knowledge
and learning, phenomenographic research on experiencing programming, and the theory
of threshold concepts. These bodies of work are examined in relation to the concept
of a “notional machine”—an abstract computer for executing programs of a particular
kind. As a whole, the literature points to notional machines as a major challenge
in introductory programming education. It is argued that instructors should acknowledge
the notional machine as an explicit learning objective and address it in teaching.
Teaching within some programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, may
benefit from using multiple notional machines at different levels of abstraction.
Pointers to some promising pedagogical techniques are provided.},

abstract = {Many teachers of CS 1 (introductory programming) have switched to Python rather than C, C++, or Java. One reason is the belief that Python's interpreted nature plus simpler syntax and semantics ease a student's learning, but data supporting that belief is scarce. This paper addresses the question: Do Python learners struggle less than C++ learners? We analyzed student submissions on small coding exercises in CS 1 courses at 20 different universities, 10 courses using Python, and 11 using C++. Each course used either the Python or C++ version of an online textbook from one publisher, each book having 100+ small coding exercises, expected to take 2-5 minutes each. We considered 11 exercises whose Python and C++ versions were nearly identical and that appeared in various chapters. We defined struggle rate for exercises, where struggle means a student spent excessive time or attempts on an exercise. Based on that rate, we found the learning for Python was not eased; in fact, Python students had significantly higher struggle rates than C++ students (26\% vs. 13\%). Higher rates were seen even when considering only classes with no prerequisites, classes for majors only, or classes for non-majors only. We encourage the community to do further analyses, to help guide teachers when choosing a CS 1 language.},

abstract="There are subjects in which teaching and learning is hard by experience.
Some subjects in physics, maths or computing seem to be difficult by nature. 
Teachers test many ways to help student learn these subjects. In Computer Programming 
the approach seems to be using higher-level languages, concepts and abstractions. 
It seems reasonable that languages similar to human language can ease the task of 
computer programming. Similar ideas are explored in other subjects. However, this 
seems contradictory with the way we construct knowledge: lower-level concepts support 
the development of higher-level ones. Is it possible to master higher-level concepts 
without previously mastering lower-level ones?"

this, we decompose recursion into a progression of function call patterns, parameter
name reuse, and data structure complexity. At each stage, we test students' ability
to trace programs using substitution. We evaluate the correctness of their traces
along multiple dimensions, finding that students generally do well, and also observe
shortcuts and identify misconceptions. For comparison, we also have students trace
two problems using a traditional, imperative notional machine. Even though the substitution
model is unwieldy to use with compound data, students still perform better with it
than with the traditional notional machine.},
