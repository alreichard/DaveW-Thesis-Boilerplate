\section{Using This Boilerplate}

Please do {\em not} edit the TeX files in the github repo.
Instead, if you're not in the CS-Ed research group,
just clone it, put your files into overleaf or your favorite LaTeX editor,
and then make your thesis.

Those in the CS-Ed group are invited to edit {\em only} the {\tt CS-Ed.bib} file,
so that we have a shared bibliography; other project bibliographies are hopefully coming soon.
