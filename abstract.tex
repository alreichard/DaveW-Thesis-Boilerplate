This ``abstract'' section should be a very brief overview that lets the reader
figure out whether they want to download and read your work or not.
The field, the question of interest, the approach to answering it,
and the contribution should all be identifiable here,
though with almost no detail about any of them.
Normally one does not cite specific papers,
or give detailed numerical results, in the abstract.
