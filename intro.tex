\section{Introduction}

This introduction would normally give an overview of the background,
and explain the purpose of this paper in more detail than the abstract did.

Specific results may be described here, and specific papers may be cited.
For example, I'll cite a one-author paper\cite{DuBoulay:Notional86},
a multi-author paper\cite{TFK:Recursion18},
and a paper about CS Education experiments\cite{FTR:Design11}.
Recursion Paper about mental Modeling if recursion \cite{GSG:Recursion03}.

Note how LaTeX pulls things from {\tt CS\_Ed.bib} (due to that name being in my main.tex), 
formats them according to the "alpha" style (also mentioned in main.tex), which gives author names/initials and years,
and then builds the ``biblography'' section and creates the
references here.
